# Ill guide you how to perform module installtion on windows laptop
# First of all please go through the Special installtion video that is there in the folder
# it tells you what to do and what not to do, installation of python and all
# then once you have done and followed that video come here and open on more cmd
# when you do that it will download some modules depending on the speed of internet it will install the modules
# once the module isntallation is done 
# you will see the cursor blinking again, if you get and error try using chatgpt first, if still you cannot install them
# call the dev team for support regarding basic installion, but only after you have tried the above step and options
# once the installion is done open the cmd again
# once that message pops up it means its done
# thankyou for following this installation.
